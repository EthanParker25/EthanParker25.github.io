        My life is a mix of music, school, and family—and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m a sophomore at Crimson Cliffs High School, but outside of the classroom,<br />
        I’m fully focused on making rap music. For me, it’s more than just a creative outlet—it’s how I express who I am, what I’ve been through, and where I’m going.<br />
        Whether I’m writing lyrics, recording tracks, or just vibing with beats, I put my heart into everything I create. I’ve still got a lot to learn, but every verse,<br />
        every freestyle, every late-night session is part of my journey.<br />
        <br />
        Balancing school and music isn’t always easy, but I’ve learned how to move through both worlds. In school, I’m focused on getting things done and building a solid<br />
        future. In music, I’m chasing a dream, creating something real, and finding my voice. It’s not always a smooth ride, but I stay committed, because I know who I <br />
        am and what I want to do with my life.<br />
        <br />
        Family means a lot to me, too. I have two siblings who keep life interesting and always bring a sense of support and energy to my world. And something I’m especially<br />
        proud of is my roots—my mom is from El Salvador. Her story, her strength, and our culture have had a big impact on the person I’m becoming. That background gives me <br />
        something powerful to represent in my music, and it’s part of what makes my voice unique.
